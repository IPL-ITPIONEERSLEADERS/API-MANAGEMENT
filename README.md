# API-MANAGEMENT
This repository shows a sample microservice and a Spring Cloud based API Management system to reach it.

The API Management and Gateway is interacting with KeyCloack IAM to secure the access to the microservices behind.

Hint : you can run Keycloack as a Docker container.

- The business microservice is : product-service-gateway-lab
- The Spring Cloud Gateway is : product-service-gateway-api-lab
